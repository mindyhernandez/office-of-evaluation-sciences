## What was the challenge?

IPTp given during ANC visits reduces chances of placental malaria and  increases the likelihood of healthy outcomes for mothers and babies. Dosage matters, with 4 doses being ideal. However, only 19% of Nigerian women received the recommended 3 or more IPTp doses during their last pregnancy. In northern Nigeria the issue is especially acute because of socio-cultural norms that prevent women from traveling outside of the home alone.  

## What was the program change?

OES, USAID, and the implementing partner, John Hopkins University (JHU), redesigned the referral process in two ways:
Engagement with husbands: the checklist that Community Volunteers (CVs) use while doing household visits with pregnant women was modified to include a specific script for engaging male partners.
A redesigned record card: The form that CVs use to refer women to ANC was modified to make it easier to use for a low-literacy population, in the form of a pictorial record card.


## How did the evaluation work?

We conducted a randomized control trial across 72 wards in Kebbi State. Randomization happened at the ward level, with 36 wards selected to receive the two-pronged treatment (husband engagement by CVs and the record card). We then measured the effect of the treatment on ANC/IPTp behaviors and attitudes. 

## What was the impact?

The results suggest no significant treatment effects from the intervention on behavior.  We find suggestive evidence that the treatment may have influenced beliefs about IPTp, if not behavior: the treatment was associated with a statistically significant increase in the number of IPTp doses that mothers report that pregnant women should take.
